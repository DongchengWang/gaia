# Gaia programming language

`Gaia` is pronounced as /ˈɡaɪə/. I like the sound of that yeah. Imagine having this conversation:

> Hey! What do you do?
>
> I'm a gaiiiiiaaaaa developer!

And whenever you encounter a bug, you can shout out:

> Gaiiiiiaaaaa~

Pretty cool, right?

I believe that the most personal is the most creative. Thus `Gaia` will be very personal at first. It's a little language that looks like `C` and runs like `C`. It has `LLVM` as back-end, and I use `LLVMSharp` to generate the IR. And it's just a beginning. Wish me luck~

## Getting started

1. make sure you have .NET 6.0 or above installed.
2. run `dotnet run`.

## Spoiler alert

My next programming language will be `Agul`, and it will be a functional programming language.
